This use case diagram provides a clear illustration of the functionalities within the Recycling Machine Application, dividing the system's usage between two primary actors: the Customer and the Operator.

The Customer interaction is focused on the recycling process and its immediate outcomes. Their primary action is to Return Item. Once an item is returned, the system automatically triggers the core functions of the application: calculate deposit and record items. Following this, the system proceeds to generate transaction details. The Customer also has the option to request receipt, which leads to the final action of print receipt. A dashed line indicates that the action of returning an item is essential for the deposit calculation to occur.

The Operator is responsible for the ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and administrative tasks of the machine. These responsibilities include monitor machine and aggregate daily data for performance analysis. A critical operational task is to resolve machine malfuction. This resolution process is linked to the system's ability to trigger alarm and potentially update deposit values, ensuring the machine is accurately calibrated after a fault. The Operator also uses the system to generate daily report based on the aggregated data and can directly modify system settings, which in turn influences the central calculate deposit function. This clear separation of concerns ensures a smooth, self-service experience for the Customer while maintaining strict operational control by the Operator.
