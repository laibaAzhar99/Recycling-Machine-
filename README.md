This use case diagram provides a detailed overview of the RUN PAYROLL BATCH process, highlighting its role as the core function of the entire payroll system. The process orchestrates interactions among four key external actors: the Employee, the Union, the Bank, and the Payroll Administrator.

The payroll batch relies on various inputs to commence, such as sales receipts and time card data provided by the Employee, as well as instructions on union dues submitted by the Union. Once triggered, the batch executes a series of critical calculations, including calculate gross pay, calculate hourly pay, and calculate overtime pay, which then feed into the final calculate net pay step.

Simultaneously, the process manages all necessary subtractions, including deduct union charges, deduct service charges, and a general Apply deductions step. After all calculations and deductions are finalized, the system generates the outputs: receive paystub for the Employee, prepare pay check, generate payment status, and prepare direct deposit instruction for the Bank. Finally, the system concludes by maintaining records through update employee payment status. The Payroll Administrator acts as the key user overseeing the entire preparation and execution of these instructions.
